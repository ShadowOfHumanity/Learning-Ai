### **Questions**

1. Why do we need a loss function?
    - The loss function tells us how incorrect the predictions are
2. Why does the gradient depend on `x`?
    - as x is an input feature, what we feed in the model
3. What happens if learning rate is too large?
    - There will be big jumps in the params (which isnt whats needed, instead slow increments that are more accurate)
4. Why doesn't linear regression handle curves?
    - Because its linear? ((w x x) + b) is a straight line
